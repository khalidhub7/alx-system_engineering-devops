Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The Nginx server had a misconfiguration in its settings, causing it to handle connections inefficiently. This led to a bottleneck, making the server crash under load. 😓

Resolution: We resolved the issue by correcting the Nginx configuration settings. After applying the correct settings, we restarted the Nginx servers, and the service returned to normal. 🔧
